thanks to [Elton's blog](http://blog.prosight.me/index.php/2009/11/485)

generate your ssh key

    # ssh-keygen

mail your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to your git server admin or just scp to the git server if you're the admin

on the git server, to the following command:

    # sudo apt-get install git-core
    # sudo adduser git
    # su - git
    # mdkir .ssh
    # cat /path/to/member's/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

you can make a git repo now, for instance:

    # mkdir test.git
    # cd test.git
    # git --bare init

you should disable git user for shell login, otherwise, people can log into your server via git user.

    # sudo vim /etc/passwd
    git:x:1000:1000::/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell

that it's, enjoy yourself.
