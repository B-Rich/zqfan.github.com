this post logs some weird problems when i use devstack

### try to get pip source but fail

devstack claims:

~~~ bash
+ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.4.1.tar.gz
curl: (7) couldn't connect to host
++ failed
~~~

disable the following statement will skip it

~~~ bash
if [[ "$OFFLINE" != "True" ]]; then
    $TOP_DIR/tools/install_pip.sh
fi
~~~
